# Interview project

## Goal

Create a small project using the Github API with the following requirements:

- Search by name using Github API and list repositories.
- Search username repositories and list them.
- Bookmark repositories.
- Page to list bookmarked repositories
- Search bookmarked repositories

## Solution

- The whole project should be done with React Hooks
- Git should be actively used when developing the project
- The project should be submitted with the public repository link which is used.

## Bonus

- Using Typescript
- Using ES6 syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc)
- Unit Tests with jest
- Use some state managers (Using useContext as a state manager is a plus)
- Having a nice UI
- Using Linters

## Recommended libraries

- @material-ui/core
- standardJs

## Comments

- You can use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.
- We have added an api.js file with the REST APIs needed to retrieve the requested information.
